# controllerbuilder-2.0
A project to build a 61-64 keys, velocity-sensing midi controller. The program also has features from the earlier version that lets the user include sliders and knobs, pitch and mod wheels, and a sustain pedal.

The "main" branch is written for AVR boards with the AtMega32u4 boards, SAM and SAMD platforms too. Other branches are written for other platforms, esp32-s3 and rp3040. The esp32 features USB only, RTP only, BLE only and a combination of all.
