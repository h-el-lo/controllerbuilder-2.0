# controllerbuilder-2.0
A project to build a 61-64 keys, velocity-sensing midi controller. The program also has features from the earlier version that lets the user include sliders and knobs, pitch and mod wheels, and a sustain pedal.

This branch is written for AVR boards with the AtMega32u4 boards, SAM and SAMD platforms too.
